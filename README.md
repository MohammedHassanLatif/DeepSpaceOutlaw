# Deep Space Outlaw
 
Created as part of a web-game development module in my 3rd year of University, Deep Space Outlaw was developed over the course of 11 - 12 weeks.

Far, far away from home and out of luck Norman Bates is on the run for several crimes by the intergalactic government. He has a killer to tail, debit to pay and more trouble heading his way. The intergalactic government takes place in a greasy, blue collar world of outlaws, truckers, cops and thieves.

The goal of the game is to destroy as many outlaws, truckers, cops and thieves as possible without getting killed. When the player shoots a space cop or a thief, they get 10 points added onto their score, while shooting an asteroid is 5 points. The spaceship is controlled by moving the arrow keys up, down, right, and left to move as desired. To shoot the lasers at the space cops, thieves or asteroids the press the spacebar on the keyboard.
